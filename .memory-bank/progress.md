## Known Issues

1. **Performance in Large Datasets**: Some operations may experience performance degradation with very large datasets.
   - Status: Under investigation
   - Priority: Medium
   - Planned fix: Optimize algorithms and data structures

2. **TypeDoc Generation**: Some complex types may not be properly documented in the generated TypeDoc.
   - Status: Known issue
   - Priority: Low
   - Planned fix: Improve TypeDoc annotations

3. **Memory Usage**: High memory usage when processing multiple large radar datasets simultaneously.
   - Status: Under investigation
   - Priority: Medium
   - Planned fix: Implement more memory-efficient algorithms

4. **Edge Cases in Coordinate Transformation**: Some edge cases in coordinate transformation may produce unexpected results.
   - Status: Under investigation
   - Priority: Low
   - Planned fix: Add additional validation and handling for edge cases

The project team is actively addressing these issues while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring the stability of the library.
