# RAAIN Model Project Brief

## Project Overview
RAAIN Model is a TypeScript library for radar-based rain measurement and analysis, used in [radartorain.com](https://radartorain.com) services. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and data structures for processing radar data, working with different coordinate systems, and performing advanced rain data analysis.

## Core Requirements
1. Provide efficient processing of radar data for rain measurement
2. Support both Cartesian and Polar coordinate systems
3. Implement sophisticated merging strategies for rain data
4. Include built-in quality metrics for measurements
5. Ensure full type safety and modern TypeScript features
6. Optimize performance with efficient data structures and algorithms

## Project Goals
- Create a robust and reliable library for radar-based rain measurement
- Provide a flexible and extensible architecture for different use cases
- Ensure high performance and accuracy in rain data processing
- Maintain comprehensive documentation and type safety
- Support integration with other systems and services

## Target Users
