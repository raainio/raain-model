# RAAIN Model Project Brief

## Project Overview
RAAIN Model is a TypeScript library for radar-based rain measurement and analysis, used in [radartorain.com](https://radartorain.com) services. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and data structures for processing radar data, working with different coordinate systems, and performing advanced rain data analysis.
